Simple Python Project

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Python project designed to help new learners understand basic programming concepts such as variables, user input, data types, printing output, and simple logic.
It is part of a larger learning series of 100 Simple Python Projects aimed at building a strong foundation in Python.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

Introduce fundamental Python syntax

Practice using variables and the input() function

Understand how programs collect and process data

Build confidence through small, easy-to-follow exercises

Each project in this series focuses on one or more core Python concepts.

🚀 What You’ll Learn

Depending on the specific project, you may practice:

Variables and data storage

User input and output

Basic string manipulation

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Loops (for, while)

Simple functions

Basic calculations and logic

📁 Project Structure

A typical project includes:

SimplePythonProject/
│
├── project.py      # Main Python script
└── README.md       # Documentation

▶️ How to Run the Project

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Run the script using:

python project.py


Or, on some systems:

python3 project.py

🧠 Example (Generic)

A typical simple project might look like:

name = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", name)


Or:

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Double the number is:", number * 2)
